## About the Project

This project simulates a game of checkers, playable directly from the command line. It supports multiple game modes, including:

* Human vs. Human
* Human vs. Computer
* Computer vs. Computer

The computer AI is designed to make strategic moves with the goal of winning.

The application is structured into three distinct layers:

* **Presentation Layer:** Handles all console interface interactions.
* **Business Layer:** Manages the core game logic and rules.
* **Data Layer:** Manages all interactions with text files, such as saving the final game results.

The game supports both English and Spanish languages.
